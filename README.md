## Description

_This is a quiz made to demonstrate to Fidgetech my understanding of JavaScript. Upon loading, users might divert their attention to either the reset button on the upper right hand corner, or to the box of text to the lower left. By clicking the checkbox and clicking confirm, users will be presented with 5 questions. When initially revealed, all but the first question will have their confirm buttons disabled. Only by going through the quiz, will you be able to reenable these buttons to progress. On the 5th confirm button, you will get a new button that will show you the results based on your answers. To reload the page, click the "reset" button on the upper right corner._
